<h3>Hey there!</h3>
<br/><br/>
We've recently made some fixes and improvements to our state bill alerts. This means we're now catching a lot more state bills that match your searches, including ones we missed earlier in 2013.
<br/><br/>
We apologize for the inconvenience; you may receive a large number of state bills in this email. This is the first time our state bill collection has seen the beginning of a legislative session across all 50 states, so the backlog is heavy. We're catching you up on these bills in one single email, rather than many, by grouping together up to the last 50 results for each of your state bill alerts.
<br/><br/>
Your state bill alerts will return to normal after this, and should be more timely and relevant than before.
