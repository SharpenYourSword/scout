We've recently made some fixes and improvements to our state bill alerts. This means we're now catching a lot more state bills that match your searches, including ones we missed earlier in 2013. We're catching you up on these bills in one single email, rather than many. 
<br/><br/>
Your state bill alerts will return to normal after this, and should be more timely and relevant than before.
