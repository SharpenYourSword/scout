  Bill text is provided by <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=BILLS">GPO</a>, and most other information on bills comes from <a href="http://govtrack.us">GovTrack</a>, through <a href="http://thomas.gov">THOMAS</a>. Information from THOMAS and GPO is delayed by about one day. Scout's data covers 2009 to the present.

  Notices of when a bill is scheduled for floor debate come from the <a href="http://majorityleader.gov/floor/daily.html">House Republican Majority Leader</a>, and <a href="https://democrats.senate.gov/floor/">Senate Democratic Caucus</a>. This information is usually published a few days in advance and can change rapidly.
