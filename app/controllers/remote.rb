# endpoint for accepting subscriptions from Twilio for SMS subscribers
# auto-signs up a user by phone number alone, adds subscription for a given bill
# 
# requirements: 
#   phone: a phone number (should not have an account tied to it already)
#   interest_type: "item"
#   item_type: "bill"
#   item_id: bill ID (e.g. "hr1234-112")
#
# optional:
#   source: string describing source (defaults to "remote")
#
# will return 500 if phone is blank, or taken
# will return 500 if interest_type is not "item"
# will return 500 if item_type is not "bill"
# will return 500 if item_id is blank
# will return 500 if remote item is not actually found
# will return 500 if credentials fail (todo)
#
# user requirements must be relaxed to allow no email address
# user will be texted a random password to log in with
# 
# user will be produced with:
#   source: "remote"
#   confirmed: false
#   announcements: false
#   sunlight_announcements: false
#   notifications: none
#   phone: [phone number]
#   phone_confirmed: false
#   password_hash: [generated random pass]
#   should_change_password: true
#
# item interest for this user will be generated as normal
# subscriptions will be initialized
#
# no notifications will be delivered, or deliveries scheduled, until user account is confirmed
