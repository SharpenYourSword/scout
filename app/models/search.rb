  # Reads in a term and returns a US code citation ID compliant with citation.js
  # 
  # This obviously duplicates some of the functionality of citation.js, but is a convenient
  # beginning, and not all of what Scout looks for in searches will be what citation.js extracts.
  # also, citation.js (will eventually) use a whole lot more kinds of patterns and processing
  # strategies than are necessary for looking at search terms in Scout.
  # 
  # If this gets more complicated, we can have this call out to a citation-api 
  # instance in the future.

  # If yes, returns the citation ID.
  # If not, returns nil.
